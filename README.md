A very special thank you to Dr. Matthew Jones-Rhoades and Dr. Ole Foresberg.

The program used to construct these data from the sequences is the Noisefinder
program. You'll find documentation for the program within the source code or
by running the program with the argument <-h>...

There are two versions of Noisefinder - 2 and 3. 2 is far more lightweight, and 
only spits out tables of data in the directory it was pathed to, while 3 has
a bunch of modules tacked onto it that plot the tables and organize the resulting
pngs and csvs into their own folders. Get familiar with 2 before you experiment 
with 3, especially if you're just here to dissect the source code. :)

All of these files and data are yours to manipulate, but hopefully you'll help me
perfect this script and let me know about anything interesting you find!

Feel free to email me any questions, concerns, or comments!
