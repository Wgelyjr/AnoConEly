Sequence data retrieved from NCBI, found with NCBI's BLASTN/BLAST+
Alignments done via MEGA7
Plotting done via R
Editing source code done in Notepad++

The paper that inspired this research: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867405007592?via%3Dihub

A very special thank you to Dr. Matthew Jones-Rhoades and Dr. Ole Foresberg.

The program used to construct these data from the sequences is the noisefinder2.py 
program. You'll find documentation for the program within the source code or
by running the program with the argument <-h>.

Plotter.R takes the output of Noisefinder and plots it, surprisingly enough.
This allows you to observe highly conserved regions located by
Noisefinder.

All of these files and data are yours to manipulate, under the condition that any
notable findings are relayed to me, and that I am credited in any publication
reliant on data generated by these scripts, or modifications to these scripts.

Feel free to email me any questions, concerns, or comments!
