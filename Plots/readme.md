This directory contains plots generated by the Noisefinder3 script, each combined
into a pdf. Each pdf contains said plots for each category - for example,
DipteraPlots.pdf contains all dipteran organisms analyzed against only each
other. Allseqs contains all insect sequence plots, each analyzed against
each other, and so on.

Some shorthand was used - for example, dmel is Drosophila melanogaster, amel is 
Apis mellifera, dpers is Drosophila persimilis. The species of Anopheles used in
this analysis was Anopheles gambiae.
