This is the most complex iteration of Noisefinder. It has the same 
functionality as NF2, but has (optional) modules that depend on Pandas, Matplotlibs,
and a few other Python packages. If you don't have them, the script *should* be fine,
but I haven't actually tested it. The added functionality includes automatically 
plotting the produced tables, then sorting them into their own folders.


I hope you enjoy!
