This is the most complex iteration of Noisefinder that I've written. It has the same 
functionality as NF2, but has (optional) modules that depend on Pandas, Matplotlibs,
and a few other Python packages. If you don't have them, the script *should* be fine,
but I haven't actually tested it. The added functionality includes automatically 
plotting the produced tables, then sorting them into their own folders, the latter
being a little bit finnicky as of right now - I'm working on streamlining it.

I also plan on writing a bit that sorts the tables using Pandas, but that's slow 
going, as I'm still just learning.

I hope you enjoy!
